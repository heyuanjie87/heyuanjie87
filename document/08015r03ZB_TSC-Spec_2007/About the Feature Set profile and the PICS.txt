The ZigBee Feature Set Profiles (also 'Stack Profiles')

These cover the functionalities that represent the respective feature set. They need to be implemented as 
written in order to assure interoperability.

The ZigBee specification has a number of options, which, if exercised in different ways by different vendors, 
will hamper both compliance testing activities and future product interoperability. The Feature Set profiles, 
which are, for the most part, a set of restrictions on the Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) 
documents corresponding to the three main sub-clauses of the specification, further restricts those options so 
as to promote interoperability and testability.

Purpose
This document defines the knobs settings, functional description and PICS for devices conforming to this stack 
profile, and is intended as the foundation for the platform compliance test plan that stack providers must pass 
in order to certify their products as ZigBee compliant. 

Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS)

The protocol implementation conformance statement (PICS) of a protocol implementation is a statement of which 
capabilities and options of the protocol have been implemented. The statement is in the form of answers to a set 
of questions in the PICS proforma. The questions in a proforma consist of a systematic list of protocol 
capabilities and options as well as their implementation requirements. The implementation requirement indicates 
whether implementation of a capability is mandatory, optional, or conditional depending on other options selected. 
When a protocol implementer answers questions in a PICS proforma, they would indicate whether an item is 
implemented or not, and provide explanations if an item is not implemented.
